\section{Body}

% Explain the paper, in your own words. Don't go into as many details as the original text, but the person reading your review should have a general understanding of the paper's results and how those results can be obtained. The structure and content of this section of course heavily depends on the paper itself. Don't hesitate to split it in multiple sections or subsections, for example:
% \subsection{An algorithm for whatever problem we try to solve}
% If your paper contains theorems, sketch the proofs of important theorems.

% \subsection{Benchmarks}
% If it contains benchmarks, show the key scores or results.

% You can follow the structure of the paper you're reviewing, but write with your own words.
