\section{Evaluation}
\label{results}

The authors implement the algorithm outlined in \secref{body} in a publicly available tool called \texttt{ct-verif}~\cite{ct-verif-github} which takes as input an LLVM implementation of a cryptographic algorithm and verifies whether it is constant-time. 
Under the covers, \texttt{ct-verif} builds on the the SMACK and Boogie frameworks.
