\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we explored the use of formal methods to verify whether a program runs in ``constant-time''. 
We first reproduced the results from an existing tool that uses program self-products and identified its scalability limitations.
We then showed that an alternate (if less elegant) approach might be a better fit for the domain by implementing an approach based on exhaustive symbolic execution. 
Finally, we showed how to lower the guarantees (albeit empirically) provided by tools that analyze intermediate representations to the actual binary that runs on hardware.
